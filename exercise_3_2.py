"""
Exercise 3.2. A function object is a value you can assign to a variable or pass as an argument. For
example, do_twice is a function that takes a function object as an argument and calls it twice:
def do_twice(f):
f()
f()
Hereâ€™s an example that uses do_twice to call a function named print_spam twice.
def print_spam():
print('spam')
do_twice(print_spam)
1. Type this example into a script and test it.
2. Modify do_twice so that it takes two arguments, a function object and a value, and calls the
function twice, passing the value as an argument.
3. Copy the definition of print_twice from earlier in this chapter to your script.
4. Use the modified version of do_twice to call print_twice twice, passing 'spam' as an
argument.
5. Define a new function called do_four that takes a function object and a value and calls the
function four times, passing the value as a parameter. There should be only two statements in
the body of this function, not four.
