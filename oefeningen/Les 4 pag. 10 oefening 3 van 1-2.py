# --> How to calculate run time
# Multiply your pace by your distance.
# If your pace is 9.5 minutes per mile and you ran 3 miles:
# 9.5 min per mi Ã— 3 mi = 28.5 minutes = 28 minutes, 30 seconds.
# --> How to calculate average pace?
# Take your running time and divide it by the distance you ran.
# For example, if you covered 5 miles in 40 minutes,
# divide 40 minutes by 5 miles and get your pace of eight minutes per mile
#--> how to calculate average speed in miles per hour
# Divide the distance by the time.
# This will give you the average speed per unit of time, usually hour.
# So, if Ben traveled 150 miles in 3 hours, his average speed is 50 miles per hour.

# If you run a 10 kilometer race in 42 minutes 42 seconds,
# what is your average pace (time per mile in minutes and seconds)?
# What is your average speed in miles per hour?


average_kilometers = (10/42)
an_mile_to_kilometer = 1.61
seconds = 0.42
average_pace = 42/6.1
total_minutes_in_seconds = (42*60) + seconds
print(total_minutes_in_seconds)
print((average_pace) + seconds)
